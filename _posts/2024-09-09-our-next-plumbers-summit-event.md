## Agenda
Participants will include the maintainers of Wasmtime, jco, and WAMR, as well as the teams working on Component and WASI support in many popular programming languages including Rust, JavaScript, Go, C#, and C++.

The event will also feature sessions on Component Model packaging, WASI proposals including wasi-nn and wasi-webgpu, and a collaborative session to create and improve documentation and tutorials.
