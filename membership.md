## For Individuals

The core focus of the Bytecode Alliance is the technical development of our hosted projects. This is the most direct way to get involved and help advance our mission, and is open to everyone regardless of affiliation.

Strong community representation is also a key tenet of our governance philosophy, and not tied to formal membership. The Bytecode Alliance offers representation for individual contributors via the Recognized Contributor Program, as described in section 5.5 of our [bylaws]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bylaws.pdf). As a group, the Recognized Contributors elect two directors to the governing Board, as well as delegates for the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/TSC/charter.md).
