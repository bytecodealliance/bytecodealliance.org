## About the Bytecode Alliance

The Bytecode Alliance is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating secure new software foundations, building on standards such as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)](https://wasi.dev).

The Bytecode Alliance is committed to establishing a capable, secure platform that allows application developers and service providers to confidently run untrusted code, on any infrastructure, for any operating system or device, leveraging decades of experience doing so inside web browsers.

We have a [vision]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance) for a secure-by-default WebAssembly ecosystem for all platforms.

                    this opens up many security concerns, and also portability challenges when you try to run

                    With WebAssembly and emerging related standards such as WASI, WebAssembly Interface

                <h4>Wasmtime</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> is a WebAssembly runtime. It runs WebAssembly outside of the browser, in a fast,
                    portable, secure, and scalable way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wasmtime serves as the base layer for other hosts. For example, Fastly is refactoring the
                    Lucet runtime on top of Wasmtime, and Red Hat is building a WebAssembly runtime based on
                    Wasmtime for the Enarx project (part of the Confidential Computing Consortium).
                </p>
                <h4>Cranelift</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a> is a highly optimized code generator, focused on fast compilation. It’s used in
                    Wasmtime for both JIT and AOT compilation, and is currently being integrated into Firefox as
                    the optimizing compiler for WebAssembly. It’s also used as an experimental backend for the
                    Rust compiler.
                </p>
                <h4>Lucet</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet">Lucet</a> is an AOT compiler utilizing Cranelift. It is meant specifically for low-latency,
                    high-concurrency server-based applications of WebAssembly.
                </p>
                <h4>WebAssembly Micro-Runtime (WAMR)</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a> is an interpreter based WebAssembly runtime, optimized for embedded and
                    resource-constrained devices.
                </p>
                <h4>Enarx (affiliated)</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://enarx.io">Enarx</a> is an application deployment system enabling applications to run within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in a platform independent way. It's a project of the <a href="https://confidentialcomputing.io/">Confidential Computing Consortium</a> that is based on Wasmtime and closely affiliated with the Bytecode Alliance.
