We’re happy to announce the 1.0.0 release of jco: a native Javascript runtime to
run WASI 0.2.0 components in. Being 1.0.0 means jco is now considered stable,
and at least for the foreseeable future will not be making breaking changes. It
can natively run WASI components inside of Node.js, making it easier to combine
components written in different programming languages with the Node.js runtime.
Providing those components access to networking, filesystem, and other system
APIs available in the Node.js runtime.

Work for support of WASI targeting the browser is still in-progress, but it can
already be used experimentally. Not all APIs available on operating system
targets can be made available to browsers. So you can expect a subset of the
portable WASI:CLI world to be available in the browser. However, work is also
ongoing to develop a browser-native WASI target in order to expose the full
breadth of features. Once the browser target stabilizes we’ll be able to discuss
that in more detail.

Finally, jco can also be used to take JavaScript code, and compile it to a WASI
0.2.0 component. This is enabled by compiling the Spidermonkey JavaScript
runtime to WebAssembly, and using it to execute JavaScript with. See the
componentize-js project for more details.

## Example

To give you a taste of what it's like to use jco, let’s compile a little Rust
program to a WASI 0.2.0 component, install jco for Node.js, and then embed the
newly built component inside of the runtime. If you want to skip ahead to the
final result, you can view it here.

## Conclusion

In this post we’ve introduce jco 1.0.0: a native JavaScript runtime which can
run WASI 0.2.0 components. We’ve discussed what has been stabilized, which
features are currently in progress, as well as future directions. Finally we’ve
shown an example of how to use jco to embed a Rust library inside of a Node.js
project.

Jco is a Bytecode Alliance project, designed and led by Guy Bedford (Fastly).
The 1.0.0 release of Jco was made possible with the assistance of Pat Hickey
(Fastly), Wassim Chegham (Microsoft), Dirk Bäumer (Microsoft), and Yosh Wuyts
(Microsoft). On behalf of the Bytecode Alliance, we’d like to thank everyone who
was involved with the conception, design, and development of jco. And we’re very
excited for people to be able to start using it in their projects!
