[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) is a lightweight WebAssembly runtime that is fast, secure, and standards-compliant. Today's release of Wasmtime v25.0 brings enhancements including extended constants, WASI 0.2.1 support, and user stack maps. 

<!--end_excerpt-->

* **extended-const** is a [proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/extended-const/blob/main/proposals/extended-const/Overview.md) to the WebAssembly standard that expands the spec for constant expressions. This release adds support for the new constant instructions (`add`, `sub`, and `mul` for `i32` and `i64`).

* **WASI 0.2.1** is the first minor release for WASI 0.2 (or WASI P2), establishing a minor release process and adding `@since` gate notation in WIT. Wasmtime v25.0 adds support for WASI 0.2.1&mdash;you can read more about the WASI release in the [announcement blog](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/WASI-0.2.1).

* **User stack maps** represent a new approach to tracking garbage collection references during compilation, ultimately allowing for fewer miscompilations and more potential optimizations. You can learn about this new approach in much more detail in [our recent blog post on the stack maps overhaul](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/new-stack-maps-for-wasmtime).

## What's new in Wasmtime v25.0

Wasmtime v25.0 includes a number of fixes and enhancements&mdash;you can find the full release notes [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v25.0.0).

### Added

* The WinML backend of wasmtime-wasi-nn now supports FP16 and I64. [#8964](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8964)

* Pooling allocator configuration options for table elements and core instance size can now be changed on the CLI. [#9138](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9138)

* Wasmtime now supports the extended-const WebAssembly proposal. [#9141](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9141)

* The `wasmtime` crate embedding API now has `ArrayRef` for allocating wasm GC arrays. [#9145](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9145)

* Cranelift now has a `stack_switch` CLIF instruction to be used with the WebAssembly stack switching proposal. [#9078](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9078)

* There are now more constructors available on `bindgen!`-generated structures for component exports now which use instantiated components rather than pre-instantiated components. [#9177](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9177)

### Changed

* The host bindgen macro now accepts a new `verbose_tracing` option, which will trace the value of `list` arguments. The new behavior of the `tracing` option is that it does not print `list` values without `verbose_tracing` also being present. [#9262](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9262)

* Wasmtime's support for WASI is now listed with the 0.2.1 version instead of 0.2.0. This is not expected to cause fallout or breakage, but please open an issue if you see any problems. [#9063](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9063)

* Work continues on Winch's AArch64 backend. [#9114](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9114) [#9092](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9092) [#9171](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9171)

* Component model resource methods can now be generated as `async` and will do so by default if async is enabled for all functions. [#9091](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9091)

* Work has continued on Wasmtime's interpreter backend, Pulley.[#9089](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9089)

* The internal implementation of `input-stream` and `output-stream` for filesystems in `wasmtime-wasi` have been refactored to directly implement the corresponding host traits. This additionally helps cleanup the internal organization of host-side resources in `wasmtime-wasi`. [#9129](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9129)

* Wasmtime now uses the new "user" stack maps in Cranelift rather than the old regalloc-based stack maps for GC references. [#9082](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9082)

* Wasmtime's handling of WebAssembly features now works slightly differently from before to provide better error messages and fewer panics on unsupported WebAssembly features depending on compiler and target selection. Additionally the reference-types WebAssembly proposal is always on-by-default regardless of crate features. [#9158](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9158) [#9162](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9162)

* The `wasmtime` CLI will now use the async version of I/O where possible to properly support `-Wtimeout` and timing out instances blocked in I/O. [#9184](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9184)

### Fixed

* Use `tracing::Instrument` in generated bindings when tracing and async are enabled, ensuring that spans aren't present in traces from unrelated async tasks. [#9217](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9217) [#9263](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9263)

* Completed support for the `CallHook` API when using the component model. [#9196](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9196)

* The compile time for a component model `enum` type with many cases should be much improved now. [#9122](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9122)

* Some minor bugfixes have been made for when Wasmtime is working with split DWARF in WebAssembly files. [#9109](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9109) [#9132](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9132) [#9134](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9134) [#9139](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9139) [#9151](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9151)

* An issue with bounds checks and dynamic checks has been fixed in Winch to ensure bounds checks are correctly implemented. [#9156](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9156)
