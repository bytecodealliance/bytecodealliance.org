The **Bytecode Alliance** is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating secure new software foundations, building on standards such as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)](https://wasi.dev).

The Bytecode Alliance is committed to establishing a capable, secure platform that allows application developers and service providers to confidently run untrusted code, on any infrastructure, for any operating system or device, leveraging decades of experience doing so inside web browsers.

We have a [vision]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance) for a secure-by-default WebAssembly ecosystem for all platforms.

                <p>Developers are running untrusted code in many new places, from the cloud to IoT devices. But
                    this opens up many security concerns, and also portability challenges when you try to run
                    the same code across these different systems. We don’t yet have a solid, secure foundation to build upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With WebAssembly and emerging related standards such as WASI, WebAssembly Interface
                    Types, and Module Linking, this solid foundation is taking shape and beginning to transform computing through growing production deployment. By building and evolving this foundation we can address some persistent fundamental issues of today’s software development practices.
